The actions we took were:
Copy test_helpers file into tests folder and updated tests/common/mod.rs
Use the same structure for the binary runner as in the linked gitopolis end to end test
Copied const and functions to create temp source and destination folders
To verify the folder path of the backup destination, we extracted the destination folder name as it was being created and used that to asset that the folder exists
Still TODO: assert the files exists
Options: move the method to extract folder path and file names to a separate function in test/common/test_helpers
